# GCP Poll Application Project: Final Report

## Project Summary

The Poll Application on Google Cloud Platform has been successfully developed, deployed, and now properly decommissioned. This project demonstrated the implementation of a cloud-native application using modern DevOps practices and GCP services.

## Project Information

**Completion Date:** April 18, 2025  
**Author:** Suthraye Shriram

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Implemented complete infrastructure using Terraform
   - Created modular, reusable infrastructure components
   - Established proper state management practices

2. **Containerized Application Architecture**
   - Developed containerized frontend and backend services
   - Implemented proper separation of concerns
   - Ensured secure communication between components

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Established Cloud Build pipeline for automated deployments
   - Implemented conditional builds based on changed components
   - Configured proper logging and monitoring

4. **Database and Security**
   - Set up Cloud SQL with proper security configurations
   - Implemented Secret Manager for credential management
   - Ensured proper IAM permissions throughout the system

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive architecture documentation
   - Documented deployment procedures
   - Captured learnings and challenges for future reference
   - Provided proper cleanup instructions

## Verification of Resource Cleanup

All GCP resources have been successfully removed, as confirmed by the following checks:

```
✓ No GKE clusters remain (verified with gcloud container clusters list)
✓ No Cloud SQL instances remain (verified with gcloud sql instances list)
✓ No custom VPC networks remain (verified with gcloud compute networks list)
✓ No project-related storage buckets remain (verified with gsutil ls)
✓ No Artifact Registry repositories remain (verified with gcloud artifacts repositories list)
```

The only remaining network is the default VPC, which is standard for GCP projects and does not incur charges.

## Key Learnings

The project provided valuable insights into cloud-native application development and DevOps practices. Key learnings have been documented in [LEARNINGS.md](./LEARNINGS.md), covering infrastructure management, database configuration, Kubernetes deployment, CI/CD pipelines, security practices, and monitoring strategies.

## Challenges Overcome

Throughout the project, various challenges were encountered and resolved. These included:

1. GKE node pool configuration issues
2. Cloud Build pipeline configuration for proper logging
3. Secret management and integration
4. Network configuration for proper service connectivity

Detailed information on these challenges and their solutions has been captured in [CHALLENGES.md](./CHALLENGES.md).

## Future Recommendations

For future projects of similar nature, consider:

1. Implementing multi-region deployments for higher availability
2. Adding more comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. Implementing automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline
4. Exploring serverless options for appropriate components
5. Implementing a service mesh for more complex microservice architectures

## Conclusion

The Poll Application project successfully demonstrated the implementation of a cloud-native application on GCP using modern DevOps practices. All project goals were met, and the infrastructure was properly decommissioned. The documentation and learnings from this project will serve as valuable references for future cloud initiatives.
